## Details

This plugin is purely WYSWIG. That is, there are no hidden HTML tags or other metadata embedded into your notes. The comments exist as you see them in the notes. Any additional styling (e.g. font color) is purely cosmetic and exists only in the editor.

The default comment style is set to HTML (`<!-- -->`), which is the syntax specified by [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#example-624). However, you can configure this plugin to use Obsidian-style comments (`%% %%`), or even define your own!

### Tips

It's recommended to replace the existing keybinding for Obsidian's comment toggling command with the one provided by this plugin:

- <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (Mac)
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (Windows)


## Support

This plugin is totally free to use! I have a lot of fun making stuff like this, so I never expect any type of financial compensation. But if you enjoy the plugin and are feeling generous, I certainly won't say no to a cup of coffee!
